# PANTHEON (The Unbreakable Spear, The Aspect of War, The Spear of Targon)

-   In battle, we are reborn.
-   Flee, and the spear will find your back.
-   I fight until the blood takes the spear from my grasp, until I can only crawl. And even then, you will not defeat me, even then, I will spit in your face!
-   The heavens do not fear me because I am a god, they fear me because I am a man!
-   Let this day be legend.
-   My name is Soldier. By my spear, they will know war.
-   They are called gods, but when they die you cannot hear their howls above the wind.
-   Brother to warriors resting beneath wheat. Son of battles a thousand times lost. I know who I am, and I will show the gods what I can become!
-   Shields defend hearts. Both yours, and those beside you.
-   I will turn the dragons' power against them, drive it deep beneath scale... this, I promise.
-   Here ends the age of dragons!
-   We cry out to the heavens... and they answer in wing and flame.
-   A dragon looms, its wings beating the song of battle... calling us to war!
-   Aatrox has slaughtered gods. But now, he faces a man.
-   It is not why I fight, but who I fight for.
-   I cast my excuses into the dirt.
-   The earth is beneath me.
-   Onward! The spear points in only one direction.
-   Even impaled on a blade, I will press forward!.
-   We live our lives in the shadow cast by a mountain.
-   Death is the only thing that ever embraced me.
-   We are what we overcome.
-   A clashing of steel... I have heard it all go silent.
-   I wield my fate as a weapon!
-   There is no pity, no mercy.
-   Pressing forward is not the same as running from your mistakes.
-   Spears grow restless before fields of wheat.
-   If they bleed, I will call them sister or brother.
-   The world moves as the heavens lie still.
-   Because we fall, the climb must be our destination.
-   I wear a helm so that I am only a soldier.
-   I will carve my scars into the heavens.
-   I buried regret in a grave, along with my name.
-   The power of these 'gods' is but an echo of our own.
-   I do not set the pace, I race against it.
-   The past marches with me.
-   There are no enemies, no allies. Only those about to die.
-   From the skies they see war, but on earth there is only carnage.
-   The art of war is hearing your heart beating, knowing you are alive!
-   If they kill me, at least I die a man.
-   I am the tip of the spear, raised against surrender!
-   I have found my limit a thousand times, and still I press further.
-   The people cry out for strength that is already theirs!
-   How much further could we march, if we were not forced to carry our fears on our backs?
-   The twilight of the gods comes each morning, when our world shines brighter than the stars.
-   We must all find our place. Mine is being cast down, so I can rise once more!
-   We are privileged to breathe, to taste the air! It is the last gasp of all who have died before us.
-   We are caught between Darkin and Aspect, but we will rise up in spite of them.
-   The stars are beyond my reach, and so I grasp my spear and take aim.
-   When I look to the mountain's peak, in my mind, I have already fallen. And so, I climb.
-   Heavier than my spear is the weight of only one life.
-   After every defeat, I ran around the mountain until even shame could not keep up.
-   The man who tastes the venom of gods, must spit his words.
-   The mountain before me is not always high. Heh, it is not always a mountain.
-   Vengeance is cold. I do not need it on the mountain.
-   Behind me lies a farm. I wonder if there is bread above the hearth, and if I will ever return.
-   Face me.
-   We bleed into the same earth, and bleed we must.
-   Why do you fight?
-   Aatrox would drown the world in blood just to stain the heavens.
-   Aatrox! The World Ender. But from death, comes life.
-   The power you sought has destroyed you, Aatrox. You will find no other end.
-   I am not the Pantheon you knew, creature. I am Atreus, a mortal, about to slay a dragon!
-   I once trusted my destiny to the stars, dragon. Now, I trust in steel.
-   The Lunari do not need a god. They need a leader.
-   Battle is a dance, and the fortunate find their partner.
-   You preach movement, while anchoring our souls.
-   Kayn. Either the weapon is redundant, or you are.
-   Hide behind your faith, Solari, and the robes of your priests.
-   Beneath Aspect and armor, you are more resilient than you know.
-   While you bow to the sun, my spear finds your neck.
-   If only your kind could see what you see, Soraka, they would weep for you as you weep for us.
-   You call yourself the Aspect of the Protector, but now the one in need is you.
-   If it isn't the Aspect everyone used to like.
-   I earned my spear with my brother's dying breath. How did you earn yours, Demacian?
-   I have faced many self proclaimed gods. The worst wears the face of a child.
-   You sought to become a god, and you were made their pet.
-   Parasite!
-   The blows of gods cannot shatter the world if they strike me instead!
-   Darkin or Aspect, it does not matter.
-   Gods need slaves, and they found you.
-   Is this a god, or a rug?
-   Our destiny is to fight, and only the bravest do not refuse it. I understand this, Lunari.
-   I am no more than a soldier, and no less.
-   I call upon the stars... to bake my bountiful breads!
-   Fresh from my bakery... my secret dream.
-   Cry, war! Louder!
-   Life was always a war.
-   A legion of one.
-   Before you fight, you must rise.
-   No mercy for the strong.
-   Until my spear dulls.
-   Let fear make you bold.
-   Strike now, strike harder!
-   Between each beat of my heart, I strike.
-   Into legend.
-   You can only defeat yourself.
-   Unbroken.
-   Willpower sets my spear alight.
-   Do not give up!
-   You will not fail if it is worth it.
-   Everything, or nothing.
-   Echo for eons.
-   Again!
-   Spear and shield. A pantheon.
-   Power will be your undoing.
-   Fight, because you must!
-   Stand up. Face me again.
-   Keep fighting.
-   How you die is who you are.
-   I will remember your name, and shout it to the heavens.
-   Glory fades into bloodstains.
-   How many hosts must I kill, Darkin?
-   The Darkin's final words are not their own... but the cries of humanity.
-   All things end!
-   Mortality can only be severed by the spear's edge.
-   The stars lie!
-   Return home on your shield.
-   I sought power on Targon's peak, only to find it within.
-   The best climbers know how to fall.
-   Retreat too far on Mount Targon, and you will fall off a cliff.
-   The god died. The man lives.
-   I will not surrender.
-   How many times must I die, before I learn to live?
-   The beyond can have me when I am done.
-   I will fall, at least one more time.
-   Stand back up and never be defeated.
